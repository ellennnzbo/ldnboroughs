# london-boroughs-viz
This is a team project aimed at investigating whether there is a relationship between cultural diversity and physical connectivity in London boroughs. Three sources of datasets were used - Ethnic group indices from the 2011 census, the CRDC 2017 Ordnance Survey Greater London Geodata pack, and data on railway stations or bus stops in London from Google maps. We used various visualisation methods to conduct an exploratory analysis. We also run several polynomial regression models for deeper statistical analysis.

We measure borough cultural diversity by the extent of diversity in the aspects of ethnicity, religion, country of birth, languages spoken and passports of the boroughâ€™s inhabitants. We quantify the physical connectivity of boroughs by the density of roads, bus stops and railway stations within the borough.
